Got it 👍 You want to save your **Google Cybersecurity Certificate notes** on GitHub in a well-structured way. Since you have **9 courses** (each with 4 modules, labs, quizzes, etc.), the best approach is to organize them into **one main repository** with subfolders for each course. That way, everything stays neat and scalable.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

---

## 1. Create Your GitHub Repo

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Click the **+ (plus)** → **New Repository**.
3. Suggested repo name:

   ```
   google-cybersecurity-certificate
   ```
4. Add a description:

   ```
   Notes, labs, and resources from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
   ```
5. Choose **Public** (so recruiters or peers can see it).
6. Add a README (you’ll customize it).
7. Create Repository.

---

## 2. Organize Folder Structure

Inside the repo, you’ll have one folder per course. Example:

```
google-cybersecurity-certificate/
│── README.md
│── Foundations-of-Cybersecurity/
│    ├── Module-1/
│    │    ├── notes.md
│    │    └── quiz.md
│    ├── Module-2/
│    └── ...
│── Play-It-Safe-Manage-Security-Risks/
│── Connect-and-Protect-Networks-and-Network-Security/
│── Tools-of-the-Trade-Linux-and-SQL/
│── Assets-Threats-and-Vulnerabilities/
│── Sound-the-Alarm-Detection-and-Response/
│    ├── Module-1/
│    ├── Module-2/
│    ├── Module-3/
│    └── Module-4/
│        ├── suricata-lab.md   ✅ (where today’s summary goes)
│── Automate-Cybersecurity-Tasks-with-Python/
│── Put-It-to-Work-Prepare-for-Cybersecurity-Jobs/
│── Accelerate-Your-Job-Search-with-AI/
```

## 3. Save Your Suricata Note

Since your Suricata lab belongs to:
**Course:** *Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response*
**Module:** *Network traffic and logs using IDS and SIEM tool*

You would save it like this:
`Sound-the-Alarm-Detection-and-Response/Module-3/suricata-lab.md`

To upload it:

1. Go to your repo.
2. Click **Add file → Create new file**.
3. Paste the Markdown I made for you.
4. Name it:

   ```
   Sound-the-Alarm-Detection-and-Response/Module-3/suricata-lab.md
   ```
5. Commit changes. ✅

## 4. Make It Easy to Navigate (README.md)

Your root `README.md` should serve as a **table of contents**. Example:

```markdown
# Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

This repository contains my notes, labs, and resources from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.  
Each course is divided into modules with notes, lab summaries, and quizzes.
